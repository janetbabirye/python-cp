print(x) #No.1a
#printing x displays the value of x which is 8.

print(y) #NO.1a
#printing y displays the value of y that is 2.

print(x*y) #No.1b
# x*y multiplies the values of x and y that is 16

print(x**y) #No.1c
#x**y is x power y that is 8 power 2 and gives the answer as 64

print(x/y) #No.1d
#x/y divides x by y and the anwser is 4

print(y//x) #No,1e
#This divides y by x and it outputs 
#the the number ignoring the decimal and the numbers after the decimal point and the result is zero.

#print(x/0) #No.1f
#This outputs an error because a number can't be divided by a zero
